### About [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

*ATTENTION* : Please do not copy and paste solution directly! Actually, I don't want anyone refer to code for solution. You can take a look if you want to know what Project Euler looks like.

> We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside Project Euler.
